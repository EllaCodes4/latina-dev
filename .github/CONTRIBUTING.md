## Adding a New Member

1. Add a new file to the `members` directory with the following format: `firstname-lastname.md`.
2. You can use the template below to get started:

   ```md
   ---
   name: Frances Coronel // your full name
   added: '2023-05-07' // Date member was added
   level: "Individual Contributor" // your level, which can be either "Student", "Individual Contributor" or "Leader"
   linkedin: 'frances-coronel' // your LinkedIn handle
   github: 'FrancesCoronel' // (optional) your GitHub handle
   twitter: 'FrancesCoronel' // (optional) your Twitter handle
   website: 'https://francescoronel.com' // (optional) your personal website URL
   ---
   ```

3. Add an image of yourself in the `public/img/members` folder

    - the image must be at least 250px by 250px
    - the image must have the same width and height
    - the image must have the same name as the file you created in step 1, formatted as `firstname-lastname.jpg`

There should be two changes in the PR you open, one for the Markdown file and the other for the image.
